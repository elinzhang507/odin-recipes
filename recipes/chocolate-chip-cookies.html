        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe around! If you do end up with any extra chocolate chip cookies, they can easily be stored for later enjoyment. To keep your leftover cookies chewy and soft, store them at room temperature in resealable food-storage plastic bags or stacked in tightly covered containers</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2¼ cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>
